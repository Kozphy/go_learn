# Linear Data Structures

## We will cover the following linear data structures in this chapter

- Lists
- Sets
- Tuples
- Stacks

## List

A list is a `collection of ordered elements` that are used to store list of items. Unlike array lists, these `can expand and shrink dynamically`.

## LinkList

`LinkedList` is **a sequence of nodes that have properties and a reference to the next node** in the sequence. It is a linear data structure that is used to store data.

They are `not stored contiguously in memory`, which makes them different arrays.

## Doubly linked list

## Sets

A `Set` is a linear data structure that has a collection of values that are **not repeated**. A set can store unique values **without any particular order**.

In the real world, sets can be used to collect all tags for blog posts and conversation participants in a chat.
