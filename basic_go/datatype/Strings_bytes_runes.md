# Strings, bytes, runes and characters in Go

## [Source](https://go.dev/blog/strings)

## Intro

In go, using String well requires understanding not only how they work, but also the `difference between` a `byte, a character, and a rune`, the difference between `Unicode and UTF-8`, the difference between a `string and a string literal, and other even more` subtle distinctions.

An excellent introduction to some of these issues, independent of Go, is Joel Spolskyâ€™s famous blog post, The [Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/). Many of the points he raises will be echoed here.
